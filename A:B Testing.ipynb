    "    - While A/B testing can be subtle, in many cases it changes the underlying user experience.\n",

    "#### Bad Generalization Practices:\n",
    "    - Assigning users to the Test or Variant group based on their signup year. user base may evolve over time and this could potentially be introducing a bias.\n",
    "    - Randomly assigning users within one country to different groups. this would be generalizable to users within that country, but potentially not to users in other places.\n",
    "    - Allowing users to change groups every time they use the service or software. it would be impossible to then correlate the change in the user behavior to the treatment.\n",

    "    - Using a hash of the randomly assigned user id to determine user groupings. This is a fine thing to do and a common way to tie the group a user belongs to to their identity."
